BetterUI for KSP2


This mod adds QOL Features to KSP2's UI.

In the future, this mod will have everything on this thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/223914-redesign-proposals-with-images-color-manager-trip-planner-experiment-popup/ 
Currently, it only has: 
Heating bar fix (Rounded, Borders)
Engineer report fix (Indicators)

Requires SpaceWarp, UITK, PatchManager and Premonition for Patch Manager
